===============

"[Let's Make a Map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/)" is a great tutorial by [Mike Boswell](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) on how to render a map in a browser using D3 ([Data-Driven Documents](http://d3js.org/)).

The HTML files here build (slightly) on that tutorial, to create a choropleth based on UK postcodes.
